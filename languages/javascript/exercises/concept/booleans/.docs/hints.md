# Hints

### 1. Decide if 'Fast Attack' action is possible

- The logical NOT operator (!) is placed before an expression

### 2. Decide if 'Approach and Spy' action is possible

- Logical expressions are evaluated from left to right and are tested for possible "short-circuits"

### 3. Decide if 'Signal Prisoner' action is possible

- Logical Operators in the order of their precedence (from highest to lowest): !, &&, ||
